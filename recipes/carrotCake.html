    <h1>Brazillian Carrot Cake</h1>
    <img src="carrotCake.jpg">
    <p>This recipe is our twist on the traditional Brazillian Carrot Cake. We love this traditional carrot cake recipe because of how easy and yummy it is. One of the times we were craving this cake we were on a sugar detox where we were trying to limit our added sugar intake. We decided to add bananas to the traditional recipe to reduce added sugar and thus was born this Banana carrot franken bread!!</p>
